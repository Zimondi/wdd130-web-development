    <h2>Pastor Munashe Zimondi</h2>
    <h3>Piddo</h3>
    <p>My name is Pastor Munashe Zimondi but people call me Piddo. I'm currently doing a degree in 
    Applied Technology. Some of the things that I love doing include playing the piano, writing songs,
    singing, making beats, playing soccer, going to the gym, drawing and going out with my family.</p>
    <p>I am married and I was blessed with two handsome boys. I currently work as a Network 
    Administrator. What I love most about BYUI is that it's a spiritual learning environment.</p>
    <p>From this course I hope to learn how to create a website. With the information that I'm going to
    get from this course I'm going to use it to create websites for myself and others.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of LDS for 16 years now. My favorite scripture is John 14:16.</p>
